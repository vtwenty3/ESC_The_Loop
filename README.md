# ESC the Loop
Escape the endless stream of personalized content and take control of your time with ESC the Loop. 

## What is ESC the loop?
ESC the Loop is a smarter app timer that sends you customizable notifications at set intervals instead of fully blocking your apps. The notifications serve as your escape plan - when clicked, you'll be redirected to your "tasks" section. ESC the loop's mission is to give your time back to you by reversing the dark patterns present in today's most popular social media platforms. With its neo-brutalist UI, animations, and haptic feedback, ESC the Loop provides an immersive and engaging mobile experience.
